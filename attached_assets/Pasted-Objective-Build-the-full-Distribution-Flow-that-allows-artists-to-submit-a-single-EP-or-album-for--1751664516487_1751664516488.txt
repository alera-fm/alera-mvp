Objective
Build the full Distribution Flow that allows artists to submit a single, EP, or album for distribution. This data will then appear in the admin review panel (already started), where it will be processed and submitted manually to DistroKid by the admin.

This flow should capture all required song and metadata inputs, validate inputs, and allow saving progress. Final submission sets release status to “Under Review.”
