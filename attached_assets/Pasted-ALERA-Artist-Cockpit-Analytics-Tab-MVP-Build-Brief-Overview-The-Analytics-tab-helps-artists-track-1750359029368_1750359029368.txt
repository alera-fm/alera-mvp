ALERA Artist Cockpit: Analytics Tab (MVP Build Brief) Overview The Analytics tab helps artists track their performance both on ALERA (distribution) and across their connected accounts (Spotify, YouTube, Instagram API's). The tab is split into two collapsible views, each housing relevant metrics, charts, and dynamic content.

UI Notes Use responsive card layouts and clean grid/table systems

Use mocked JSON data for now

All platforms can be conditionally rendered based on OAuth connection

Charts via Recharts or other flexible library

Maintain UI consistency with homepage (button size, card corner radius, font)

Development Goals Build full front end of Analytics tab with two collapsible panels

Each platform/component in its own section

Dropdown filter for My Alera Releases (Total + each release)

Mock all dynamic metrics + charts for now

Indicate locked/future metrics visually with lock icon or blur effect

I've attached JSON file for mock data. Make sure you keep the design preference as the current site uses
