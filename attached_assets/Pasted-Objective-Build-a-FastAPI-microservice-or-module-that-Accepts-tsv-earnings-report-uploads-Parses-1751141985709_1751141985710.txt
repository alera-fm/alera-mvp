Objective
Build a FastAPI microservice or module that:

Accepts .tsv earnings report uploads

Parses and stores earnings data (by artist, platform, and month)

Serves that data to the frontend for summary charts + tables

Accepts and stores withdrawal requests for manual admin handling

Data Source: DistroKid .tsv Reports
You will manually be sent .tsv reports weekly by Zaki. They contain:

Reporting Month | Sale Month | Store | Artist | Title | Quantity | Song/Album | Customer Paid | Country Of Sale | Earnings (USD)

We will use:

Sale Month = actual month the stream/purchase happened

Store = platform (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)

Earnings (USD) = revenue per row

Artist = links to the internal artist record

🔧 Backend Features to Build
1. Upload Earnings Report
POST /upload-revenue-report

Accept .tsv file upload

Parse each row and store:

artist_id (map via name or metadata)

sale_month

platform

earnings_usd

Overwrite any existing entry if it already exists for artist + platform + month

2. Aggregated Earnings Summary
GET /wallet/summary?artist_id=xxx&range=30days

Returns:

total earnings over selected time period

breakdown by platform

GET /wallet/history?artist_id=xxx

Returns:

monthly totals for graphing

Filters supported: 7 / 30 / 90 days / All time

3. Withdrawal Functionality
Artists can request payouts of their wallet balance. You do not need to handle actual transfers — just simulate and store them.

POST /wallet/request-withdrawal
Payload:

{
  "artist_id": "abc123",
  "amount_requested": 100.00,
  "method": "PayPal",
  "account_details": "encrypted_email_or_bank_info"
}

Store this request with status pending

Admin will mark as paid or rejected manually later


GET /wallet/withdrawals?artist_id=xxx
Returns a list of all withdrawal requests and their statuses

4. Add: Payout Method Management
This should be a separate backend feature, but part of the wallet module.

POST /wallet/payout-method
Artists can submit their preferred payout method and account details

Payload:

artist_id

method (e.g. PayPal, Bank Transfer)

account_info (email, IBAN, etc. — stored encrypted)

GET /wallet/payout-method?artist_id=xxx
Retrieves the current saved payout method info (masked or minimal data)

Security Notes
All sensitive info must be encrypted at rest (or stored via a secure third-party vault if used later)
